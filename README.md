## Why 3MS?

Why use the 3MS when there are many other multi-material systems?

Here are a few reasons:

- **Simplified Design**: Minimal mechanical complexity for increased reliability.
- **Low Cost**: A 4-filament-unit 3MS can be built for ~$150 USD
- **Easily Sourceable**: All the parts for the 3MS are available on Amazon. Alternatively, you can purchase a 3MS kit from [West3D](https://west3d.com/products/3ms-the-simple-and-reliable-multi-material-system-kit-by-3dcoded).
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Step-by-step guides to ensure smooth setup and operation.
- **Scalable**: Easily expand the system to handle any number of filaments.

## Requirements

To use the 3MS, your setup has to meet the following requirements:

- Run Klipper firmware
- Have SSH (PuTTY) access (99.9% of Klipper installations have this, and if you don't you really should setup SSH)
- Have one spare USB port
- Have an adapter to install a PTFE tube to the inlet of your printer's extruder.
