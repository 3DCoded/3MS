# Creality K1 and Ender 3 V3

## WIP

Creality K1 series and Ender 3 V3 series printers run a heavily modified old version of Klipper, along with a reduced Linux system. Because of this, setting up Happy Hare firmware will be less straightforward than a properly setup Klipper and Linux system.

See the [docs]() for a guide on how to install HH on these printers.
