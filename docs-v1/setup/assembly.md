# Assembly

Follow this guide to assemble your 3MS.

## Printed Parts

An optional board enclosure for the SKR Mini E3 is available [here](https://www.printables.com/model/459809-bigtreetech-skr-mini-e3-v3-enclosure).

Additionally, an optional universal mount for the MK8 extruder using M3 bolts is available [here](../assets/stls/mk8m3.stl). Note that this requires 2-4 M3 bolts and a place to screw the bolts into.

~~Finally, you will need to print enough of [these](https://www.printables.com/model/541678-bambu-ams-no-catch-y-splitter-pc4-m10) Y splitters for the filament.~~

The Y-splitter available [here](https://www.printables.com/model/122982-mini-splitter-v2-for-mmu21s-mod-pc4-01-fitting-ver) is now recommended.

## MK8 Assembly

Next, assemble the MK8 extruders onto the NEMA17 motors using the provided instructions that came with them. If you use the mount provided above, make sure it is in between the MK8 and NEMA17. 

## Wiring

!!! note "Note for Certain Printers"
    If your printer has Klipper running internally (not on an external computer), the controller (if not a main MCU config) is plugged into a USB port on the printer itself.

Follow one of the following guides based on your controller:

- [SKR Pico](skrpico.md#wiring)
- [BTT MMB](bttmmb.md#wiring)
