Follow this guide to get faster and more reliable toolchanges with your 3MS.

## Does My Filament Need Tip Shaping?

If your filament is in this list, then it likely won't need tip shaping, and you can try out the experimental [No Tip Shaping](notip.md):

- PLA (not Silk, Matte, or glitter variants)
- PLA+ (including PLA Pro, Tough PLA)
- PETG

If you filament wasn't in that list, continue reading this page.

## Blobby Tips

If your filament tip has a thicker tip after unloading, you can do two things:

1. Print hotter
2. Decrease cooling moves

## Stringy Tips

If your filament tip has a stringy tip after unloading, you can do two things:

1. Print colder
2. Increase cooling moves

You may also be able to use the experimental [No Tip Shaping](notip.md).

## Hook of Death

If you filament tip can't unload out of your extruder and forms a hook shape, you may need to replace the PTFE tube between your printer's extruder and hotend.
