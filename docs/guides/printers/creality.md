# Creality E3v3 series

## Introduction

The Creality K1 Ender 3 v3 series printers run a heavily modified Klipper and Linux installation. Because of this, setup isn't as straightforward as on a genuine Klipper and Linux install. If you have another printer running mainline Klipper, it is highly recommended to install the 3MS on it instead.

If you would like to use the 3MS on an E3v3, read on.

!!! tip
    Please read every step here carefully. If you run into issues, please reach out on the 3MS Discord (link on homepage) and note the step you are having trouble with.
