# BOM

## Number of filament units

First, choose the number of filament units you want. Each filament unit lets you print with an additional filament. Two filament units are the minimum. You can add or remove filament units after building, but the BOM and configuration will vary based on how many filament units you want.

## Controller BOMs

Choose the BOM for your chosen controller from the list below:

- [BTT SKR Mini E3 V2](skrminie3v2.md#bom)
- [BTT Octopus (main MCU)](bttoctopusmain.md#bom)
- [Zonestar ZM384 (main MCU)](zm384main.md)
- [Mini RAMBo](minirambo.md)

## Filament Unit BOMs

For each filament unit, purchase this BOM:

| Name | Quantity | Price | Link | Notes |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| NEMA17 Stepper Motor | 1 | $9.99 | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/06Lsa1qI) | You can use a pancake stepper if you want, but it will have less torque
| MK8 Metal Extruder | 1 | $9.99 | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/0gJ1ghKj) | Alternatively, you can use [this](https://a.co/d/dbw7Wor) Dual-drive MK8 based extruder |
| Capricorn PTFE Tubing | 1 | $11.49 | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/0dLLBGzJ) | You likely won't need this for every unit, as this is usually too long for only one unit |
