# BOM

## Number of filament units

First, choose the number of filament units you want. Each filament unit lets you print with an additional filament. Two filament units are the minimum. You can add or remove filament units after building, but the BOM and configuration will vary based on how many filament units you want.

## Controller BOMs

Choose one of the following Controller BOMs for whatever controller you want:
