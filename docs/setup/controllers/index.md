# Controllers

Follow this guide to determine which controller to use in your 3MS.

## Options

The 3MS works on multiple different controllers. 

!!! info
    If your printer's mainboard has spare stepper ports, you can use them to control 3MS steppers. You can open an issue on Github (there's a template) to get a configuration made for your specific setup. Any controllers listed with "(main MCU)" use those spare stepper plugs.

Choose one of the following supported controllers (a checked box indicates it is fully tested, and an empty box indicates testers wanted):

- [X] [SKR Mini E3 V2.0 (4 colors)](skrminie3v2.md)
- [X] [Einsy RAMBo (main MCU) with SKR Mini E3 V2.0 (3ms MCU)](einsyrambo-skrminie3v2.md)

    !!! warning "Expert modification"
