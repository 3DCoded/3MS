# First Print

Follow this guide to begin your first multimaterial print. There are two main ways to prepare a model for multimaterial painting. 

## Method 1: Multimaterial Painting

This method allows you to turn any model, even if it's not designed for multimaterial printing, into a multimaterial print. First, import your model into the slicer. In this case, a 3DBenchy will be used.

++command+i++ OR ++ctrl+i++

Next, select the model and click multimaterial painting at the top.

++n++

Once you're in this menu, you can choose any tool, tool size, and filament. Now, just drag over the model to apply the selected tool to the model. In this case, the hull of the 3DBenchy will be set to filament two using the fill tool.

Finally, hit slice and your model is ready to print!

## Method 2: Multimaterial Model

This method allows you to turn parts of a model to different materials. For this tutorial, this [T-rex by Cipis](https://www.printables.com/model/5481-t-rex-multi-material) will be used. First, import your model into the slicer. If prompted while opening to treat the model as multiple parts, select "Yes".

++command+i++ OR ++ctrl+i++

Next, go to object settings and change the different parts of the model to different colors.

Finally, hit slice and your model is ready to print!

## Wipe Tower Position

In the examples, you may have noticed that the wipe tower is far from the model. The travel time between the model and wipe tower adds up, and moving the tower closer can help reduce print time.

In the "Prepare" view, click and drag the wipe tower as close to the object as you can without colliding.

If you have a camera on your 3D printer, you may want to put the wipe tower "behind" the part from your camera's perspective.
