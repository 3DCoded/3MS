| - | - | - | - | - |
| NEMA17 Stepper Motor | 1 | $9.99 | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/06Lsa1qI) | You can use a pancake stepper if you want, but it will have less torque
| MK8 Metal Extruder | 1 | $9.99 | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/0gJ1ghKj) | Alternatively, you can use [this](https://a.co/d/dbw7Wor) Dual-drive MK8 based extruder |
| PTFE Tubing | 1 | $8.99 | [Amazon](https://a.co/d/7FAhmS5) | You likely won't need this for every unit, as this is usually too long for only one unit |
