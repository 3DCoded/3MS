# Filament Cutter

Filament cutters completely remove the hassle of tip shaping and can allow for even faster toolchanges.

!!! info "Inactive"
    The goal of the 3MS is to be as simple as possible. Adding a filament cutter adds another layer of complexity. For now, it is recommended to either use [Tip Shaping](tipshaping.md) or try out the [No Tip Shaping](notip.md) feature. See [Materials](materials.md) for which feature you should use for each of your materials.

!!! info
    This page, and the features mentioned on it, are in develpment

???+ "Development Status"
    So far, the following have been tested:

    - [X] Custom universal filament cutter design
    - [X] Klipper Configuration
    - [ ] Print tests
        - [ ] 10 Toolchanges
        - [ ] 50 Toolchanges
        - [ ] 100 Toolchanges
    - [ ] Speed tests
        - [ ] 20 second toolchanges
        - [ ] 15 second toolchanges
        - [ ] 10 second toolchanges
        - [ ] less than 10 second toolchanges

## BOM

The 3MC (3MS filament cutter) uses a high torque servo and a custom filament cutter design to cut filament quickly and reliably.
