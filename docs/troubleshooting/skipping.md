# Motor Skipping

If any of your extruder motors are skipping while using the 3MS, follow this troubleshooting guide to diagnose the issue and fix it.

## Printer's Extruder

First, check if your printer's extruder is properly extruding. To check this, detach the PTFE tube from the inlet of your extruder, and manually load filament, using Klipper's controls for loading filament. If your printer's extruder is having trouble extruding plastic, you may have one of the following:

- [Heat creep jam](https://all3dp.com/2/3d-printer-heat-creep/)

## 3MS Extruder

If the printer's extruder is working properly, and you're still having skipping, check the filament tips. If the tip has a long string on it, or has a thick blob at the end, your filament tips may be to blame. If you have stringy tips, decrease your nozzle temperature while printing. If you have blobby tips, increase your nozzle temperature while printing. Alternatively, you can purchase [PTFE tubes with a larger ID](https://a.co/d/7o45tW5) to allow for less precise tips.
