## What about the 3DChameleon?

I recently created a klipper plugin for the 3DChameleon after purchasing a unit. I'm sure my Chameleon could have worked if I had tuned it further, but after several months with only partial success, I gave up. I am still open to pull requests for **[3dchameleon-klipper](https://github.com/3dcoded/3dchameleon-klipper)**, but I won't be able to test it myself anymore.
