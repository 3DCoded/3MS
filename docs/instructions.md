# Master Instructions

Due to the modularity of the 3MS, there are many ways to set it up. This guide attempts to encompass all supported was of setting up the 3MS.

## Basic Steps

The basic steps this guide will follow are:

1. Choosing your controller
2. Getting a BOM
3. Assembling your 3MS
4. Configuring your 3MS
5. Stepper motor setup
6. Slicer setup
7. First print
8. Troubleshooting

## 0. Explanations

Before starting the instructions, a basic understanding of how the 3MS works is recommended. There are two types of components in the 3MS:

- Controller

    This controls the stepper motors

- Filament Units

    This moves the filament

The number of filaments you will be able to print with is equal to the number of filament units you have. For example, two filament units will let you print with two colors. It is important to note that one filament unit will NOT let you print in multimaterial.

## 1. Choosing your controller

There are many controller options for the 3MS. For each, there are two main deciding factors:

- How many filament units does it support?
- How much does it cost?

Here is a simple table comparing these two factors across all supported controllers:

| Name | Max Filament Units | Base cost (no filament units) | Cost per filament unit |
| - | - | - | - |
| SKR Mini E3 V2 | 4 | $52.40 | $20.00 |
| SKR Pico | 4 | $53.40 | $20.00 |
| FYSETC Spyder | 8 | $59.40 | $22.04 |
| SKR 1.4 Turbo | 5 | $83.40 | $20.00 |

After you have chosen your controller, proceed to step 2.

## 2. Getting a BOM

After you have chosen the controller you want to use, go to [BOM](bom.md) to view the bill of materials for your controller and the number of filament units you want.
